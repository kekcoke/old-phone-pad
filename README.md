The program emulates a old numpad behavior minus the user interface.

Given a character sequences resembling data entered in the old numpad, it converts thosse into its corresponding letter, if any.

Limitations.

1. Case-insensitivity. 


Future considerations.

1. Multi-mode. Enable cha
2. File I/O; requires more asynchronous handling and dynamic memory allocation to account varying filesize.
3. Create U/I. For the nostalgia and enabling learning to younger generations who weren't exposed.
4. Predictive text. A huge undertaking, likely after 3. Can supercede 3 for text analysis cases.
